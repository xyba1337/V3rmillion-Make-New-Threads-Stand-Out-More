# V3rmillion-Make-New-Threads-Stand-Out-More
This tampermonkey script will detect any old thread and then changes the background color and text color of them to a darker variant, in order to make new threads stand out more.

I made this script because for me personally, new threads weren't outstanding enough and it annoyed me.
